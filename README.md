# Differential Gaussian Rasterization

Used as the rasterization engine for the paper "HUGS: Holistic Urban 3D Scene Understanding via Gaussian Splatting". If you can make use of it in your own research, please be so kind to cite us.

The code is built based on "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields" https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/diff-gaussian-rasterization.
